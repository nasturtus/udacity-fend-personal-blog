          <h1 class="article-title">Art of Reading</h1>
          <h2 class="article-subtitle">What happens when you read. Actually read.</h2>
          <p>
            There's very little about hip-hop that has stayed with me, other
            than trying to like the cool kids who did it. The cool kids had no
            philosophy, but it was a similar phenomenon for me. Returning to the
            review, I should make it clear that philosophical works alone are
            not a good genre. In other books, I am able to rationalize things
            away and continue my cheerful superficial reading. If I don't take
            the time to understand what I'm learning, I'm doing my career a
            disservice. But I see the Wired story as an introduction to a skill
            I want to master.
          </p>
          <p>
            After my revelation, I decided to read it again. After reading it
            again, this time I studied it as a doctoral student preparing a
            dissertation. Following this framework, I have developed, re-read
            and refined a handful of other books over the past year. In a
            nutshell, you have the ability to come up with two important habits:
            reading and understanding. The art of thinking can be divided into
            two components: the ability to read and to learn how to learn, which
            I will discuss in a later article. Firstly, it is not enough to know
            how to do something. This brings us to Google Search.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last and most important aspect of effective and efficient
            reading is technique. There is one reading technique that will help
            most, and that is to improve our consistency. The technique is that
            most of the articles I have read so far are beginning to realise
            that some of the things are pointless and not right. The first step
            to reading well is readiness to read. To fall in love with the act
            of reading yourself. Think of effective reading as a well-designed
            rocket: efficient reading is a necessary upgrade of its performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The combination of the two will be the best way to top up your
            reading routine, and each is valuable in itself. Another way to look
            at this question is to read more. Read less, read more, read a lot.
            I imagine you are in the same boat. To read more is one of our most
            common goals. I look forward to showing you a few ways in which you
            can read and remember more, and I would like to hear your thoughts.
            It is a discussion with many different levels and many interesting
            possibilities. One of the most obvious acronyms for reading more is
            to read less.

            <strong>Roald Dahl</strong>, for example, said that you can only go through life if
            you read a lot of books. Similarly, <strong>J.K. Rowling</strong> said that something
            magical happens when you read good books. In this thoughtful book,
            Damon Young, honorary professor of philosophy at the University of
            Melbourne, examines the reader's power to turn words into worlds. It
            is obvious that writing is only the first step in this process, but
            for the reader it is meaningless. Visualization and interpretation
            are unique for each individual.
          </p>
          <blockquote>If you are a discerning reader,
            ask questions about the book. The answers should be recorded while
            they are still fresh in the mind. The aim is to make the authors
            "ideas as easy to understand as possible.</blockquote>
          <p>
            At this point, your notes should concern the structure of the book,
            not its content or the strength of its arguments. You should know
            the general idea of the blueprint. If you are a discerning reader,
            ask questions about the book. The answers should be recorded while
            they are still fresh in the mind. The aim is to make the authors
            "ideas as easy to understand as possible. You extract the core
            meaning, which is universal to the author's words, and reproduce it
            in your own writing. You control your knowledge of your domain.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Note:</u> If you are dealing with a number of different authors, it is
            unlikely that they all use the same terms and keywords. At the
            syntopical reading level, you must select a term or keyword and use
            one of the authors to develop your own terminology. By analytical
            reading, however, one can identify the language chosen by the
            authors and locate it by means of art terms. Write down your
            observations and a brief summary of what you read at the top and
            bottom of the page. Circle the things you want to come back to
            later. Place asterisks around passages that you find interesting.
            Place a number of additional side edges.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h3 class="article-summary">Parting words</h3>
            At its most fundamental level, the human mind is fascinated by
            images and visual representations of meaning. We learn to understand
            best when we see how an idea plays out in front of us. The reason is
            that they represent themselves. It is hard to believe that Gove, or
            any parent, teacher, writer, librarian, bookseller or reader, does
            not want our children to discover the rush of enthusiasm and
            appreciation that comes when we look at great books and think about
            the world. Gove is an educated man who recognises that the
            re-dedication of art reinforces notions of cultural identity that
            are loved and practiced by Left-wing political regimes. In this
            context, the row over novels coming from Britain and America, and
            the ensuing row over them, may seem silly and decadent. But we
            should have the humility to say that not everything is like that.
