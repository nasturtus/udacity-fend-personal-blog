**Introduction**

Apart from the points mentioned in the rubric, my idea was to use **only** three colours. I chose black and white for their simplicity and an HTML5 colour called *tomato* to break the monotony.

**Website components**

The three complete pages to this blog site are:
- index.html
- 404.html
- art-of-reading.html

Links to all other blog articles mentioned will lead to a 404 page.

- To decide on various breakpoints I referred to the following blog post, also mentioned in one of the mentor responses in Udacity's Knowledge forum. [Sawan Rathod](https://medium.com/@sawanrathod/css3-media-query-cheat-sheet-1fab77ea3cb8)
