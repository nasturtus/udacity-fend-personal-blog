**Introduction**

Apart from the points mentioned in the rubric, my idea was to use **only** three colours. I chose black and white for their simplicity and an HTML5 colour called *tomato* to break the monotony.

**Website components**

The three complete pages to this blog site are:
- index.html
- 404.html
- art-of-reading.html

Links to all other blog articles mentioned will lead to a 404 page.
